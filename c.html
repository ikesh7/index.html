  <h1>My Childhood</h1>
  My childhood was very happy. I didnt had much to do than to sleep all day or even go outside to play. There were no worries. Life was just so simple. I could easily get anything I ever wanted. I read in a nearby school when I was a kid because my parents thought it would be hard for me to travel some distance to go to my school. I was a bright kid when I was in school. I would score very good marks in exam without even studying. I wish life would be like that every day. I spent most of my childhood without worries. I didnt had anything to do .
